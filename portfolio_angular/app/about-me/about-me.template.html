<h1>About Me</h1>
<span class="email">Email:</span> <span class="secondaryText">matthew [at] ecologylab.net</span>
<p>I'm a Front-end Developer, UX Researcher, and Ethnographer. I graduated from Texas A&M University with my Master's Degree
   in Computer Science in Fall 2017.
<p>My advisor was <a href="http://ecologylab.net/people/andruid/index.html">Professor Andruid Kerne</a> who heads the <a href="http://ecologylab.net/">Interface Ecology Lab</a>.
   A version of my thesis, <a href="#!/papers/lgbtVisibility">"Queer Visibility: Supporting LGBT+ Selective Visibility on Social Media"</a> was accepted for publication at CHI'18.
<p>Beyond HCI, I'm a fan of pop music, drag race, cosmetics, and video games (esp. Fire Emblem and The Legend of Zelda).
